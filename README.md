## Description

The 42 NetPractice project is a hands-on educational initiative designed to teach students network programming and related concepts through practical exercises. Participants are tasked with building and managing networked applications, gaining experience in various network protocols, socket programming, and data transmission methods.

The project emphasizes real-world scenarios, requiring students to implement client-server models, handle multiple connections, and ensure data integrity and security. By engaging in these tasks, students develop a deeper understanding of how networks operate, how to troubleshoot and debug network issues, and how to create efficient and reliable networked applications.

Overall, the 42 NetPractice project aims to equip students with the fundamental skills necessary for careers in network engineering, software development, and IT infrastructure management, blending theoretical knowledge with practical, hands-on experience.
